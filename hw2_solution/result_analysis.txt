The result clearly shows the effect of the RM scheduling
polic. Task t1 is of a higher priority level, and thus
its response time is approximately equal to its execution
time (50 ms). Interestingly, while we set the execution
time for Task t2 to 80 ms, the resulting response time is
around 130 ms for most cases. This implies that each round
of execution of t2 was delayed by the execution of t1 once
(which has 50 ms execution time), i.e., 130=80+50.
