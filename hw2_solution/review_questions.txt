Q1 Answer:
Anytime algorithms may improve the responsivenss of a system,
because when the deadline occurs they will produce the latest
version of the result; in other words, the responsiveness of
a task scheduled by an anytime algorithm is upper-bounded by
the smallest between its deadline and its WCET. Note that
this also implies that other applications (i.e., other tasks)
will not be further delayed by this task. So, the overall
responsiveness of a system is improved. The utilization of a
system may be improved because, as long as time permits, such
algorithms may keep iterating for a better result.

Q2 Answer:
The answer is yes. Because the total CPU utlization of this
task set is 70%, which is less than 82%, the bound of the RM
scheduling policy for a two-task set.

Q3 Answer:
Here is one possible answer:
Task1: p1=4, c1=3
Task2: p2=5, c2=1.1
In this case, the first release of task 2 will miss its
deadline should we suppose that the system begins at the
critical instant.
