Q1 Answer:
SCHED_OTHER tries to ensure fair progress among all threads
of 0 priority level; SCHED_FIFO prioritizes the execution of
threads by their relative priority levels. See `man sched`
for a more detail account.

Q2 Answer:
No. sched_priority refers to the real-time priority.
setpriority() only changes the nice value of the process.
They are independent.
See both `man sched` and `man setpriority` for detail.
